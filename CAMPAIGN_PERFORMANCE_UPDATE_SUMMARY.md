- `neutral_replies` (other/null responses)
- `success_rate` (calculated percentage)

## ðŸš€ How to Apply

1. **Frontend Changes**: âœ… Already applied
2. **Database View**: Run `enhance-campaign-view.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After applying the database changes:
- Campaigns sorted by success rate (highest first)
